h264_player:

  A player that is designed to play back exactly one video, for now:
  http://www.h264info.com/clips.html, download The Simpsons Movie
  trailer, and run mplayer -dumpvideo foo.mkv. The resulting
  stream.dump file is the input file for h264_player.

  Note that it does not do any frame reordering, so the output is very
  jittery. Also since it doesn't have access to the picinfo, it's
  hardcoded to the right thing (so other videos are unlikely to play).
